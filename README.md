# Give-away-Utility-Calculator
Summary:
Short python project that tells users whether to enter give away competition based on total expected utility. Using PyQt6 to explore how to create GUI's in Python.

Detail:
I wanted to explore using PyQt6 so whilst this is a very basic app, it was created with the view of learning and deploying particular widgets in Python and how to switch between pages in an application etc.
The code itself delves into many PyQt6 modules such as font, color, hoverbutton widgets.
